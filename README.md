### My Coding Journey
I'm one of the generation of bedroom coders from the ZX Spectrum days, but I was always unsure if it was something I wanted to do as a career. So, as a student, I split my studies between computers, business, and education (I was always being pushed towards being a teacher).

At the end of my first year as a student, I presented to prospective students how computers could be used in the transport industry. A few years later, I was working in the transport industry. Coding hadn't quite disappeared from my life, though I eventually didn't own a computer myself. I would still code at work to make life easier for myself and sometimes my co-workers.

Upon leaving the transport industry, I jumped around a few jobs—usually helping people improve how their office ran by writing small scripts or apps—until I was offered the chance to roll back the years and become a developer once more.
