### My Coding Journey
I'm one of the generation of bedroom coders from the ZX Spectrum days, but I was always unsure if it was something I wanted to do as a career.  So as a student, I split my studies between computers, business and education (I was always pushed towards being a teacher).  At the end of my first year as a student, I presented to prospective students how computers could be used in the transport industry.  A few years later, I was working in the transport industry.  Coding hadn't quite disappeared from my life, although I eventually didn't own a computer myself, I would still code at work to make life easier for myself and sometimes my co-workers.  Upon leaving the transport industry I jumped around a few jobs usually helping people improve how their office ran by writing small scripts or apps, until I was offered the chance to have a go at rolling back the years and becoming a developer.
